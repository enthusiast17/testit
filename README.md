# testit

### Installation

```
go get github.com/enthusiast17/testit
```

### Why I created this repository?

We (students) aren't allowed to use non-standard packages in my [school's tasks](https://alem.school). I do a lot of tests for my projects and I'm tired of creating the same things over and over again.

### Will this repository be useful for me?

I don't know. D=

### Will this repository be updated?

Yes!
